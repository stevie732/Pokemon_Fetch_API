This project was another assignment given to me while enrolled in Coding Temple. I utilized HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. My goal was to build a very basic API and then build a landing page around it in which it would Fetch data from the API. I've created a tutorial in which I would build this project from scratch. A great project for beginners and those just starting off learning to code.
